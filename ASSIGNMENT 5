ASSIGNMENT 5: WRITE A PROGRAM THAT HANDLES EXCEPTIONS BY

USING TRY, CATCH, AND FINALLY BLOCKS

Requirement:

Write a python program that prompts the user to input a number.

Attempt to divide a fixed number (e.g., 10) by the user-provided number.

Use try, catch, and finally blocks to handle any potential exceptions (e.g., division by

zero).

Print appropriate messages in the catch block for exceptions.

Ensure the finally block is executed to perform any cleanup operations (e.g., closing

resources).
sol:
def calculate_division():
  try:
    user_number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / user_number
    print(f"The result of dividing 10 by {user_number} is: {result}")
  except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero. Please enter a non-zero number.")
  finally:
    print("Program execution completed.")
calculate_division()
